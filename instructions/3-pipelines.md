## Assignment 3: Pipelines

#### 3.1 Creating a pipeline

Up until now, GitHub has accepted every single Git push, whether the build was succeeding or not. 
The next step is to create a pipeline / GitHub workflow that builds on every commit, the same way we are doing locally. 

1.  Read the [quick start documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) at GitHub.
2.  Create a file called `.github-actions-demo.yml` in a folder called '.github/workflows' in the root of the project.

Try and experiment with the provided example that you found in the GitHub quickstart.

3.  Push the pipeline workflow definition to GitHub and verify that pipelines are being executed under `🚀 Actions` in your personal GitHub repository.

4.  Assuming your build is now green, you can continue with the next step.


#### 3.2 Building our project in the pipeline

Now we'll create an actual pipeline for our project. Inspired by the quickstart example above

1. Create a new job called 'Build' and add a step that executes an `npm build`: 
        
    Did you manage to get a green build? Great! Most likely however, the pipeline returned an error such as: 
    ```
    sh: 1: react-scripts: not found9
    Error: Process completed with exit code 127.
    ```
    Why is this the case?

2. Create a second job called 'Test'
   Add a step that runs the unit tests. Make sure it only runs if the Build job was successful.
   
   *Note*: Check the `needs` attribute of a job.


#### 3.3 Adding SonarQube to the build pipeline

Now that we have a basic build up and running in our pipeline we would also like to connect SonarQube reporting into the pipeline.

To connect with SonarQube we will need to have our SonarQube `url` and `token` available in the pipeline.

We don't want to have secrets or credentials stored in our version control system as they could show up in our (public) code base. Therefor we will need to register the secrets in github, so that we can use it later on in our pipeline.

In assignment 2.3.3 we've created an environment file. Add both environment variables to our pipeline and get the values from a GitHub secret stored in GitHub.

#### 3.4 Limit the branches the CI will trigger on.

Our pipeline / workflow now triggers for every branch. Experiment with the workflow to see if you can limit the branches our CI pipeline gets triggered for.
